This project is designed to facilitate translation between Arabic and English, supporting multilingual functionality for the application. 

The app uses manual translation, which requires you to input each word in both language files: `en.json` for English and `ar.json` for Arabic. 

Please note that the localization services should remain untouched. To access these translations within the app, you can use the following syntax: `'AppLocalizations.of(context)!.'`.

The packages used are: 
flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter

The assets related are: 
 assets:
    - assets/lang/ar.json
    - assets/lang/en.json
